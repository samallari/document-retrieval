## ICS 624 Project: Document Retrieval 

Advances in information retrieval have introduced sparse, dense, and hybrid retrieval methods each offering unique trade-offs between efficiency and semantic relevance. In this project, we aim to evaluate and compare sparse (TF-IDF, BM25), dense (MiniLM+FAISS), and hybrid (Reciprocal Rank Fusion, weighted-sum) on three benchmark datasets: MS MARCO, HotpotQA, and Climate-FEVER. We analyze performance using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and retrieval time, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Results show that hybrid retrieval achieves the best balance, delivering competitive MRR with low latency, while sparse methods excel in interpretability and speed but struggle with semantic matching. Dense retrieval, though effective for semantic alignment, faces scalability challenges, failing on larger subsets due to memory constraints. Our findings underscore the task-dependent nature of optimal retrieval strategies, with hybrid methods emerging as a robust solution for diverse IR applications.
